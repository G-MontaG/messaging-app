# Messaging App

To run the application in development mode:

```zsh
yarn start
```

To prepare build for production:

```zsh
yarn build
```

To execute tests:

```zsh
yarn test
```

## Notes

I didn't cover the application with the unit tests due to limited time. But to show you that I didn't forget about them, I covered `threadsService.tsx`.
